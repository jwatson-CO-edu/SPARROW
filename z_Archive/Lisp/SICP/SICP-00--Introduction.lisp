Basis and Philosophy
|#

#| We want to establish the idea that a computer language is not just a way of 
getting a computer to perform operations but rather that it is a novel formal 
medium for expressing ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written 
for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. 

Lisp descriptions of processes, called procedures, can themselves be represented
and manipulated as Lisp data. The importance of this is that there are powerful 
program-design techniques that rely on the ability to blur the traditional 
distinction between "passive" data and "active" processes. 

In general, when modeling phenomena in science and engineering, we begin with 
simplified, incomplete models. As we examine things in greater detail, these 
simple models become inadequate and must be replaced by more refined models. |#
