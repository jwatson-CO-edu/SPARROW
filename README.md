# Petri Language  
An interpreted language written in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/), with the goals of learning language design and introducing straightforward, automated parallelism to the computing world.

## `DEV PLAN`
```
[ ] Finish Nim tuts
    [Y] Part 1: Basics, 2022-03-23
    [ ] Part 2: Classes and Exceptions
    [ ] Part 3: Metaprogramming and Macros
[ ] Translate first evaluator to Nim
[ ] Translate "The Little Javascripter" by Douglas Crockford
    https://www.crockford.com/little.html (See `JS` folder)
[ ] Parse "Easy S-Expressions" instead: 
    Implicit open paren, `;` is close paren
    <funcName> <arg1> ... <argN>;
[ ] Experiment with memory models
[ ] The Seasoned Schemer
[ ] Practical Common Lisp
[ ] Concurrency Model & Scheduling
    [ ] Petri Representation?
```

    - Birds are cool
* Execution Model: [B]asic [O]peration e[X]change for [F]lows [A]agents and [B]ehaviors
    - Possible extension to behavior trees
    - An execution model based on Petri Nets that seeks to support commonsense solutions to Job Shop Scheduling problems as they relate to computing
