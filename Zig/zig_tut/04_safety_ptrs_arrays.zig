// https://ziglearn.org/chapter-1/#runtime-safety
// Zig provides a level of safety, where problems may be found during execution. 
// Safety can be left on, or turned off. Zig has many cases of so-called detectable illegal behaviour, 
// meaning that illegal behaviour will be caught (causing a panic) with safety on, but will result 
// in undefined behaviour with safety off. Users are strongly recommended to develop and test their 
// software with safety on, despite its speed penalties.

// Safety is off for some build modes. // FIXME: IS SAFETY DISABLED FOR `run`?

///// Array Pointer /////
// Sometimes you may have a pointer to an unknown amount of elements. 
// [*]T is the solution for this, which works like *T but also supports indexing syntax, 
// pointer arithmetic, and slicing. Unlike *T, it cannot point to a type which does not have a known size. 
// *T coerces to [*]T

///// Slices /////
// Slices can be thought of as a pair of `[*]T` (the pointer to the data) and a `usize` (the element count). 
// Their syntax is given as []T, with T being the child type. Slices are used heavily throughout Zig 
// for when you need to operate on arbitrary amounts of data. Slices have the same attributes as pointers, 
// meaning that there also exists const slices. For loops also operate over slices. 
// String literals in Zig coerce to []const u8.

// The syntax `x[n..m]` is used to create a slice from an array. This is called slicing, and creates 
// a slice of the elements starting at `x[n]` and ending at `x[m - 1]`. This example uses a const 
// slice as the values which the slice points to do not need to be modified.
